# Project "How to learn"
### This project teaches us how to learn.  
### It sounds strange, but neither school nor university is taught this.  
### The landing page contains a lot of useful information and links to resources that will help to understand this topic even deeper.  
***
### Nested BEM was used in the project. Github.com is used as a remote repository.  
### The code has been verified by https://validator.w3.org/.
